## Technical Details

### Password Generation

The application uses Python's `random` module to generate cryptographically secure random passwords. The generated passwords include:

- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Special characters (!@#$%^&\*)

### Common Weak Passwords

The application maintains a blacklist of common weak passwords that should be avoided:

- "password"
- "123456"
- "qwerty"
- "abc123"
- "password123"
- "admin"
- "letmein"
- "welcome"

## Usage Guide

1. Enter your password in the input field
2. Click "Check Password Strength"
3. Review the strength assessment and feedback
4. If your password is weak, consider using the suggested strong password
5. For new accounts, use the "Generate Password" feature to create a secure password

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be made:

1. Add password history tracking
2. Implement password expiration reminders
3. Add support for password strength visualization
4. Include more detailed password analysis
5. Add the ability to save favorite passwords (securely)
6. Implement password breach checking
7. Add support for password policies (e.g., company requirements)
